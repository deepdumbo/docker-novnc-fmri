Instructions on how to update releases to the BIAC tools.

(1) Set your CVSROOT environment variable to the CVS repository root: \\Munin\Data\Programs\Source\CVSRepo
  set CVSROOT=\\Munin\Data\Programs\Source\CVSRepo

(2) Make a working directory for MATLAB source.
  mkdir /my/working/matlab

(3) Check out the latest branch of the MATLAB source.
  cd /my/working/matlab
  cvs checkout -r matlab-3-1-4-1 matlab
  [Doesn't work??]

(4) Make sure all desired changes are committed to CVS.
  cvs commit -m "Update description" file.m
  [Is this right?]

(5) Choose a new version number NEWVERS (e.g. 3.1.4.2), and update
VersionHistory.txt to include entries of interest for the new version.
You can get a diff from the previous release or a particular date from
CVS like this:

  cd /my/working/matlab
  cvs diff -b -u -r OLDTAG
  cvs diff -b -u -D OLDDATE

where OLDTAG is something like matlab-3-1-4-1 or OLDDATE is something like
'2008/03/25'.  The -b option ignores differences in newlines (UNIX vs.
Windows).

(6) Commit VersionHistory.txt to CVS.

  cd /my/working/matlab
  cvs commit -m "Update version history" VersionHistory.txt

(7) Tag the CVS tree with the new version number.  The CVS tag is
matlab-TAGVERS, where TAGVERS is the same as NEWVERS with any dots replaced
with dashes (e.g. matlab-3-1-4-2).  Here is how you tag:

  cd /my/working/matlab
  cvs tag matlab-3-1-4-2

If you accidentally forgot to commit something and need to update the tag
for a file, you can "force" re-tagging like this:

  cvs tag -F matlab-3-1-4-2 [optional file list...]

(8) Now update the standard location (\\Munin\Data\Programs\MATLAB\BIAC)
with the changes by either copying the updated files (in most cases this is
the easiest option) or re-checking out a fresh copy based on the tag:

  cd /temporary/directory
  cvs -d ~/net/munin/data/Source/CVSRepo checkout -r matlab-3-1-4-2 matlab
  
and then copying it to ~/net/munin/data/Programs/MATLAB/BIAC.

(9) Now go to munin/data/Programs/MATLAB and copy the BIAC directory into
a new directory with a date and version label, zip it up, and copy it to
BIAC_matlab_latest.zip:

  cd ~/net/munin/data/Programs/MATLAB
  cp -r BIAC BIAC_matlab_20090423_ver3.1.4.2
  zip -r BIAC_matlab_20090423_ver3.1.4.2.zip BIAC_matlab_20090423_ver3.1.4.2
  cp BIAC_matlab_20090423_ver3.1.4.2 BIAC_matlab_latest.zip

All done!
